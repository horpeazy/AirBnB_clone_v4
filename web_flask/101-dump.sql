Our host, Cindy, was there to welcome us when we arrived, brought us freshly baked cookies, and offered many good suggestions for sightseeing, exploring, and eating.  The Roost was the perfect size and setting, in addition to being well-supplied with things we needed.  We all loved being together and checking out the immediate area and beyond.  The younger grandkids especially loved watching the trains go by, and the older ones had a great time at the Renaissance Festival, the old mine site, hiking, and a couple of museums in Phoenix.

Randall was an excellent host and communicated often, even asking if I needed any specific groceries. The studio is exquisite: it\s decorated very well and has far more amenities than some 5-star hotels I\ve stayed in.

And then there\s the amazing shower (and yes, there\s a deep, jetted tub for those of you who prefer long baths). He offered many toiletries for my use, even Origins masks, which I splurged on and used two. The bed was comfortable and the rugs that are on the floor are nice and soft; bring slippers or socks if you get cold feet, though, as most of the floors are not carpeted.

The jacuzzi tub was a perfect way to relax after a day of wine tasting. Downtown is a 5 minute drive away and all the wineries are an easy, beautiful drive.

We didn\t have electricity on the second day and couldn\t use any of the kitchen appliances to prepare food. The road into the ranch crosses a riverbed, and you will want to have a high-clearance vehicle during and after inclement weather (and maybe at other times as well; we were there during a rainy spell). There is plenty of opportunity to spend time outside, but we didn\t find a terribly conducive spot. It\s difficult to move through the river bottom near the ranch, so hiking is somewhat limited except along the road. Lots of wildlife though and definitely a quiet place to pause and reflect.  ),(68f6b461-8e34-474f-9359-d1b900fb3423,2017-03-25 02:17:07,2017-03-25 02:17:07,b13b1a74-3a12-4f00-8c19-273cbedc0eaa,3ea61b06-e22a-459b-bb96-d900fb8f843a,Juan\s place is a great place in the heart of Bisbee.

You have to go up this narrow, steep, cobblestone road. Best to do it with a spotter. But if you can commit to parking and then walking for the rest of your trip, it\s worth it.

The kitchenette was especially handy and well stocked with gear and basic food supplies. Even though the cottage is located in a pretty adjoining garden to the back of the house, it felt very private. There’s even a small secluded patio near the cottage entrance that would be lovely to use in nice weather.

Jim went over and beyond what was expected. I\m a tennis coach and brought my 9 year old and 7 year to compete in a tennis tournament in Meridian. We cooked  meals and enjoyed the house as much as our busy scheduled allowed. Jim\s house is going to be a real winner on airbnb. I was coaching 8 other families who all over paid for hotels in Meridian and when they saw the room my family had they were extremely jealous. I\ve stayed in Airbnb\s all over the world as a professional tennis coach and this was by far the most historic and unique stay I\ve had. It was also my wife\s first stay in an airbnb and she was a little apprehensive at first. It took no time for her to get hooked. Glad to know when we travel as a family all of us will pick airbnb!

Located in Beaverton, just a short drive from downtown and the airport, it was a quiet escape nestled on the end of the street in a nice neighborhood. We rented a car, so the drive downtown was super quick and easy but there is public transit as well. The house itself was perfect for us because we like to cook, so the kitchen had everything (and more) that we needed to whip up a meal. There are tons of games and cards to play during a fun night in front of the cozy fireplace. Also, the bed was the most comfortable we\ve ever slept on, even more than our bed back home.

My boyfriend and I came here for a laid back anniversary weekend. The setting was lovely and the wine and chocolate was a great touch. The kitchen area was greatly appreciated, as we prefer to be able to cook our breakfasts. The kitchen was nicely stocked with a few pans and even spices (though we brought our own). We did not see the host, however we did see some of the other guests that were staying in different rooms. We were able to come and go as we pleased. The only notable discrepancy I had was the plumbing. The shower would sometimes shut off while in use. It\s a \cabin\ of sorts so these types of things are to be expected I feel, so it didn\t bother me too much. ),(b44b2000-fae1-45a7-99df-62555b9d2524,2017-03-25 02:17:07,2017-03-25 02:17:07,31568a3f-d5b1-47d1-b2ee-74339059e3a0,70b18dcc-08ef-4040-91cf-4075973d320a,The cottage is just as it is pictured.

It was a straight up rate.<BR /><BR />Bill is a straight up man of integrity. This is what made my stay so wonderful. <BR /><BR />I have stayed at many hostels around the world with similar rates, but you have to put up with a lot more crap, such as kitchens that are dirty, missing appliances, using a nasty dormitory room with snoring, and clothes around the floor, and there have been many other guests who are both well-mannered and ill-mannered. I also include the hostel staff in this smorgasbord. I also used Couchsurfing some years ago, and I met a few marvelous people through it, but lately the site, and the people running it have messed up its system. AirBnB has taken the slack and created a new way to visit new places - and it has marvelous gems like Bill\s place in Globe.),(f7220024-e952-4520-8559-2093cae28db4,2017-03-25 02:17:07,2017-03-25 02:17:07,5463e312-5bf4-4764-8c06-e97c5548f712,cf1780e6-d294-4113-8749-1c728b9e3f81,The place is great, in a calm and quite area.
